Parallel matrix multiplication
------------------------------
Build
$ make compile

Clean
$ make clean

Generate input file
$ python gen.py [file-name] [#rows-matrix1] [#columns-matrix1] [#columns-matrix2]
e.g:
$ python gen.py in.txt 800 1200 800

Run
$ ./mul [#threads] [input-file]
e.g. running single thread multiplication
$ ./mul 1 in.txt
e.g. running 8-thread multiplication
$ ./mul 8 in.txt

Notes
-----
1) [#columns-matrix1] also specifies [#rows-matrix2].
2) For the best performance run as many threads as you have cores.
3) mul will print the result to stdout as well as the time it took to run the multiplication
