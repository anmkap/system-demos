Totally Ordered Multicast
-------------------------
Clean
$ make clean

Build
$ make

Run the coordinator process (proc_id = 1)
$ ./sub 1 [coordinator_port] [num_proc] [proc_1_port] [proc_2_port] ...

Run worker process
$ ./sub [proc_id] [proc_port] 1 [coordinator_port]

Testing
-------
1) First run the coordinator
$ term0$ ./sub 1 44445 2 33331 33332

2) Run worker processes in separate terminals in quick succession
$ term1$ ./sub 2 33331 1 44445 > out2
$ term2$ ./sub 3 33332 1 44445 > out2

Notes
-----
Coordinator process will print the forwarded messages to stdout.
When the clients exit, the coordinator will print "Error connecting".
You can now open the output files and to inspect the order of message delivery.
You can also compare the output files by running:> diff out1 out2 | grep Delivered
The last delivered message(s) could be printed if they were delivered to one process when the other had just exited.
